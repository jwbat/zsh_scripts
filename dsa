    Itâ€™s better to solve one question a week by self than to do 50
     by taking a look at the solutions.

    Develop your intuition first.For that , read about basic DS 
    (lists, trees, stack, queue, map and heap).
    Once you are able to balance a tree or do a 
    tree inversion, move to graphs. BFS and/or DFS is the Hello World of graphs.

    Once you understand these , congratulations. You can solve any problem 
    in the world through brute force. Most problems can be modelled 
    as a graph search and running BFS will give you the answer.

    Then comes the step to learn optimisation. Think about specific algorithms.
    Learn to identify when you can use simple recursion, back 
    tracking and dynamic programming. Once you start seeing patterns for each 
    case, you would be able to solve most medium level problems on leetcode efficiently.

    The final step will be to learn specific algorithms like KMP, Manacher, etc.
