The **WiiM Pro's digital preamp** (i.e., its digital volume control, EQ, and tone settings)   
is **also bypassed** when you set it to **fixed output** and send the signal   
via **digital out (optical/coax)** to an external DAC.  

---

### 🔍 What Is the Digital Preamp Doing?

The digital preamp in the WiiM Pro includes:

- **Digital volume control**
- **EQ settings** (bass, treble, loudness, etc.)
- **High-pass filters**, crossovers for multi-room setups
- Possibly upsampling or DSP-based enhancements

These all affect the **digital signal before it's converted to analog** — but only when you're using:

- The **analog RCA outputs**, or  
- The **variable volume control** even on digital output (which some users accidentally enable)

### 🎯 To Fully Bypass the WiiM's Internal Preamp *and* DAC

Here’s what to do:

1. **Use digital output** (optical or coax)
2. **Set the output level to *fixed*** (in the WiiM app):
   - Go to **Device Settings → Audio Settings**
   - Set **"Volume Control"** to **Fixed**
3. **Disable EQ / tone controls / DSP** (if you want a bit-perfect signal):
   - Turn off any EQ or loudness compensation
   - Leave sample rate settings on native/pass-through

✅ This ensures you're sending a **pure digital bitstream** to the external DAC — no attenuation, no EQ, no DSP — and **letting the DAC and amp handle all the heavy lifting** from there.

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters

Using WiiM this way turns it into a **"bit-perfect streamer"**, and the external DAC + amp (or preamp)  
become the defining factors of your sound quality.  

It’s a really smart modular strategy — **cheap to upgrade or swap the streamer**,  
but you can keep your investment in a top-tier DAC or analog preamp for years.  

---

### Is the streamer now sonically invisible?

**in theory**, a properly configured "bit-perfect" streamer 
like the WiiM Pro **should have zero impact on sound quality**,
because it's just **passing along digital data unchanged** to the DAC.

But in **practice**, it’s worth considering a few small caveats. Let’s break it down:

---

### ✅ **What “Bit-Perfect” Means**

A bit-perfect streamer:

- Outputs the **original digital stream** (e.g., from Qobuz, TIDAL, etc.) without:
  - Volume changes
  - EQ/tone shaping
  - Resampling or upconversion
- Leaves **everything up to the DAC** — the streamer is just a digital delivery system

So yes, **if the streamer is configured correctly** (fixed volume, EQ off, etc.), it’s effectively **sonically transparent**.

---

### ⚠️ **Where Things *Might* Matter Slightly**

Even with a bit-perfect output, some argue a streamer *can* affect sound quality due to:

#### 1. **Jitter**
- Slight timing variations in the digital signal
- Good DACs with **asynchronous reclocking** eliminate this
- The WiiM Pro has a decent clock; high-end DACs are designed to ignore bad clocks entirely

#### 2. **Electrical Noise (EMI/RFI)**
- Poorly isolated streamers can transmit noise via the ground plane through **coaxial S/PDIF**
- **Optical (TOSLINK)** completely isolates streamer and DAC electrically — best for clean signal

#### 3. **Power Supply**
- Switching power supplies in cheap streamers *could* introduce noise into analog gear via shared power grounds — but again, if you're using optical output, this is a **non-issue**

#### 4. **Network Traffic or CPU Activity**
- Some believe that noisy network or CPU activity in the streamer can impact performance, but this is extremely unlikely with a proper digital output

---

### 🧠 So the Takeaway:

If you're using:

- **Optical digital out**
- **Fixed output mode**
- **No EQ / DSP**

…and feeding a good external DAC:

> 🟢 Then yes — the **WiiM Pro becomes sonically invisible**, and the **entire sound quality is determined by your DAC and what comes after it** (amp, speakers, room, etc.)

Would you like to test for bit-perfect output from your setup or want recommendations for DACs known to have great jitter rejection and transparency?
