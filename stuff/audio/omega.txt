Hi Louis,

    This is James from Stevenson, WA very happy new owner of a fabulous pair of SAHOs.

    The main purpose of this email is just to send you a huge thank you (and maybe get any
    feedback on my setup you might observe).  Now in place is what I already consider to be
    my first -and last- true audiophile system.  

        Bluesound Node Nano streamer
        Denafrips Pontus DAC
        Brunoco Terra 6L6 PP integrated tube amp
        Omega SAHO speakers

    The attached picture shows the current setup.  One little detail to add:  I have a 12 dB Harrison
    Labs attenuator on the input to the amp from the DAC b/c the amp is at least 20 wpc, and I wanted
    to win more range on the volume pot than would otherwise be available.

    This is just a temporary and probably less than ideal location as we renovate
    the studio / listening room. The room shown is a bit challenging since it kind
    of forces the SAHOs what seems to me to be too close together.

    Even so, the imaging for near- to mid-field listening, and even farther back, is exquisite.
    There is only a tiny bit of toe-in after starting out with more.  The soundstage and live, pure tonality are
    just delicious.

    Even though I cannot yet try them in a more foregiving space, I'm wondering if they look too close 
    together to you?  
    Do they generally like to be closer to the side walls?  They are at least 1/3 in from their
    respective side walls or even more.  Close to the rear wall is working great for bass response.

    I guess anything you might observe would be immensely appreciated.  Thank you again for helping put
    together a dream-come-true audio system.

    James
