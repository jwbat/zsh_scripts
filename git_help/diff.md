## Diff

```sh
git diff develop            # compare current branch with another branch, `develop`
   
git log develop..HEAD       # list all commits unique to this branch

git diff --stat develop     # summary of which files have changed, without seeing the actual diff

git diff                    # see local changes not yet committed
```
