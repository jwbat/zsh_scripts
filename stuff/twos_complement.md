# What is Two's Complement?

Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, as well as a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a radix complement. It is used to represent signed integers in most modern computers.

In the two's complement system, positive integers are represented as regular binary numbers. Negative integers are represented by the two's complement of the absolute value of the number.

# How Does It Work?

For positive integers and zero, the two's complement representation is the same as the standard binary representation. For example, the two's complement representation of +5 in 8-bit form is `00000101`.

For negative integers, the process is a bit more involved:

1. **Find the binary representation of the absolute value**: For \(-5\), the absolute value is \(5\), and its 8-bit binary representation is `00000101`.
2. **Invert the bits**: Flip all the bits (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). For `00000101`, the inverted bits give `11111010`.
3. **Add 1**: Add 1 to the result. `11111010 + 1` becomes `11111011`.

So, the 8-bit two's complement of \(-5\) is `11111011`.

# Let's Work Through a Simple Case: \(-3\)

To find the 8-bit two's complement representation of \(-3\):

1. **Find the binary representation of the absolute value**: The absolute value of \(-3\) is \(3\), and its 8-bit binary representation is `00000011`.
2. **Invert the bits**: Inverting the bits gives us `11111100`.
3. **Add 1**: Adding 1 gives us `11111101`.

Let's calculate it.

The 8-bit Two's Complement representation of \(-3\) is \(11111101\).

This system allows for easy addition and subtraction of signed integers, and it's widely used in computer arithmetic.
