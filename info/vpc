\t In the context of Amazon Web Services (AWS), VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. A VPC is a logically isolated 
\t virtual network within the AWS cloud, allowing customers to launch resources such as EC2 instances, RDS 
\t databases, and Elastic Load Balancers in a virtual network that they define.

\t VPCs give customers control over the virtual networking environment,
\t including IP address ranges, subnet creation, and routing tables. Customers can also create public
\t and private subnets to isolate resources, control network access with security groups and network access control lists 
\t (NACLs), and connect to on-premises networks or other VPCs using VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

\t A VPC can span multiple availability zones within a region, allowing for high availability and fault tolerance.
\t AWS provides a default VPC for each region, but customers can also create custom VPCs with the desired configuration. 
\t VPCs are a fundamental building block of AWS infrastructure, and they provide a secure and scalable way to run
\t resources in the cloud.
