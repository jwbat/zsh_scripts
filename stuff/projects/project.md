✅1. Complete device documentation for hand off to API (Parker)
✅2. Reproduce Milesight “Refresh” test using the UG63 and report outcome to MS
✅3. Reproduce UG63 in BasicSation mode issue: Tstat takes LONG time to join compared to other devices (maybe HW V2 fixes this?)
4. Barry has observed that when he runs a Schedule on v1,
   if he overrides the Set Point with Tstat buttons,
   it doesn’t always resume on the next Schedule transition.
   Need to try to reproduce this and report it (maybe V2 fixes?)
