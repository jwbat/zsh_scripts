Based on the details of your Starlink setup,
a WiFi bridge does seem like the more appropriate
and straightforward choice compared to a portable router.

The key reasons why a WiFi bridge is well-suited for connecting your 
LoRaWAN gateway to Starlink internet:

1. Simplicity: A WiFi bridge's main purpose is to convert the existing WiFi signal from your Starlink router into a wired Ethernet connection, which is exactly what you need for the LoRaWAN gateway.

2. No separate WiFi network: Since you already have the Starlink WiFi network, you don't need an additional WiFi access point like a portable router would create. The bridge just utilizes the existing Starlink WiFi.

3. Fewer networking capabilities needed: WiFi bridges have more limited routing, DHCP, firewall features compared to a router. For just connecting the LoRaWAN gateway, you don't need those advanced capabilities.

4. Compact size: Many WiFi bridges are designed as compact travel/mobile devices, making them very portable.

The setup would be:

`Starlink Dish > Starlink Router (WiFi) > WiFi Bridge (Wireless to Wired) > LoRaWAN Gateway`

By connecting the WiFi bridge to the Starlink WiFi and then plugging the LoRaWAN gateway into the bridge's Ethernet port(s), you get a straightforward way to provide the necessary internet connectivity. No complex router configurations needed.

So in this scenario where you just need to connect one wired device to Starlink's WiFi network, a dedicated WiFi bridge is likely the most fitting and convenient solution compared to a full portable router.


To connect your LoRaWAN gateway to the internet via the Starlink router
using the TP-Link TL-WA801ND WiFi bridge, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the Starlink router and connect it to the Starlink dish to get internet connectivity.

2. Power on the TP-Link TL-WA801ND WiFi bridge and connect it to a power source.

3. Access the TP-Link bridge's configuration interface, usually by connecting to its default WiFi network (check the documentation for default SSID and password).

4. In the bridge configuration, find the "Operating Mode" or "Mode" setting and select "Access Point (AP) Mode" or "WiFi Bridge Mode".

5. Then find the "Wireless Security" or "Wireless Settings" section. Here you need to enter the SSID (WiFi name) and password of your Starlink router's WiFi network.

6. Save these settings on the TP-Link bridge. It should now connect wirelessly to your Starlink router's WiFi as a client.

7. Connect your LoRaWAN gateway to the TP-Link bridge using an Ethernet cable plugged into the bridge's LAN port.

8. The bridge should now pass through the internet connectivity from the Starlink WiFi to your LoRaWAN gateway via the wired Ethernet port.

A few additional tips:
- Place the TP-Link bridge in a location with good WiFi signal from the Starlink router.
- You may need to reserve/assign a static IP on the Starlink router for the bridge for reliable connectivity.
- Disable the bridge's own WiFi if you don't need a separate wireless network from it.
- Check that NAT is enabled on the bridge if your gateway needs internet access.

So in summary, configure the TP-Link as a WiFi bridge, connect its wireless to the Starlink WiFi, and then the gateway directly to the TP-Link's Ethernet port to bridge the internet connection.

# How to assign a static IP address on the Starlink router for the TP-Link WiFi bridge

The Starlink router likely has a section in its admin interface to manage the DHCP server settings and assign static IP addresses. The exact steps may vary, but generally:

1. Login to the Starlink router's admin interface (check documentation on how to access it, likely 192.168.1.1 or similar)

2. Find the section related to "DHCP Server" or "LAN" settings

3. Look for an option to "Reserve IP addresses" or "Static IP Addresses"

4. This will allow you to map a specific IP address to a device's MAC address

5. You'll need the MAC address of the TP-Link WiFi bridge, it's printed on a sticker on the device itself

6. In the router's reserved list, assign an IP address you prefer (e.g. 192.168.1.50) and enter the TP-Link bridge's MAC address

7. Save this static DHCP reservation on the Starlink router

Now whenever the TP-Link bridge connects to the Starlink WiFi,
it will always get assigned that same 192.168.1.50 IP 
from the router instead of a random DHCP address.

This static IP reservation makes it easier to access the bridge's config pages 
and ensures the IP doesn't change, which can help with reliable connectivity in some cases.

Most routers today have the ability to assign static DHCP addresses.
