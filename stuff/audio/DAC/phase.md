### Default Phase Setting on the Pontus 15th:

* The **default phase is "Normal" (0°)** — that is, **not inverted**.
* On the front panel, the **PHASE LED** is **off** in this default state.

### What it means:

* **Normal phase (0°)**: The positive parts of the waveform remain positive, preserving the polarity of the original signal.
* **Inverted phase (180°)**: The waveform is flipped — positive becomes negative and vice versa.

### When to use inverted phase:

* Only if:

  * Your source device inverts polarity, or
  * You notice consistent imaging or tonal issues (rare).
* But **most recordings and gear follow standard polarity**, so **Normal (LED off)** is the safest and most likely factory setting.

So unless you're troubleshooting something specific,  
you can assume it's set correctly and just leave it at the default.
