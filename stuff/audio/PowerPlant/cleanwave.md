## Breakdown on whether the **Brunoco Terra 6L6 tube amp** or **DAC (e.g., Denafrips Pontus)**   
would benefit from PS Audio’s **CleanWave** feature.

---

### 🔧 Would the **Terra amp** benefit?

**Possibly**, but marginally at best.

* The Terra uses **large iron-core transformers**—power transformer, output transformers, and possibly a choke—all of which can **retain residual magnetism** over time.
* Tube amps, particularly push-pull designs, are **sensitive to transformer core biasing**, which can theoretically impact symmetry, noise, or tonal balance—but **only subtly** and over **long periods** of use.

**However:**

* High-quality transformers (like those likely used in the Terra) are designed with **low-hysteresis cores** and materials that **resist permanent magnetization**.
* Unless the amp has been running for hundreds of hours at high volume without power cycling, it’s unlikely to show any measurable degradation.

🔍 **Verdict:**
CleanWave **won’t hurt** and *might* offer a tiny improvement in long-term noise floor or transformer symmetry, but it’s **not necessary** for a well-designed, modern tube amp.

### 🎧 What about **DAC** (e.g., Denafrips Pontus)?

Even **less likely to benefit**, because:

* The DAC's transformers (in the power supply) draw relatively little current.
* Digital gear doesn’t magnetize cores the way high-current analog gear does.
* Denafrips uses high-grade parts, with excellent shielding and power design.

🔍 **Verdict:**
Highly doubtful the DAC would need degaussing unless one is chasing **extreme marginal gains**.

---

### ✅ When *might* CleanWave be worth using?

* After **long listening sessions at high volume**
* If you detect subtle **loss of dynamics**, **tonal shift**, or **added noise** that wasn’t there before
* Periodically, as a sort of **“reset” maintenance** for your system (say, once a week or after a long jam session)

---

### TL;DR

* **Terra amp**: CleanWave might provide a slight benefit, especially over long periods—but the effect is minor and likely imperceptible with high-quality parts.
* **Pontus DAC**: No meaningful benefit expected.
* **CleanWave is safe** and may offer psychological peace of mind more than sonic improvement—but feel free to run it occasionally.
