### 🎚️ What Inline RCA Attenuators Are

They're **passive voltage dividers**: a pair of precision resistors inside a barrel-style RCA plug that reduces signal level by a fixed amount (e.g., -10 dB or -15 dB).

There’s **no active circuitry**, no power, and ideally no added noise — they’re very simple devices.

### 🎧 Do They Affect Sound Quality?

#### ✅ **High-Quality Attenuators**:

* Use **tight-tolerance resistors** (1% or better).
* Are designed with **impedance matching** in mind (e.g., 10k–100k input impedance).
* Have **transparent, neutral sonic character** — virtually no coloration if well made.

#### ⚠️ **Lower-Quality or Poorly Matched Attenuators**:

* Can result in:

  * **High-frequency roll-off**
  * **Loss of dynamics**
  * **Impedance mismatch** issues, especially with certain tube gear
* These effects are subtle but noticeable in **high-res systems** like yours.

| **Rothwell**        | -10dB RCA Attenuators                         | Made in UK, widely praised, neutral       |
| **Harrison Labs**   | -12dB or -3dB "Audio Attenuators"             | Very affordable, surprisingly transparent |
| **GoldenJacks**     | Custom dB values available                    | UK-made, audio-grade resistors            |
| **Or custom-built** | By reputable techs with Vishay/Dale resistors | Boutique but ultra-transparent            |

All of the above have been used **between DACs and tube amps or power amps** in **high-sensitivity speaker systems** with good results.

### 🔍 Where in the Chain?

If you’re planning to:

* Use the **Terra’s built-in volume control** (no external preamp),
* And your **source is a 2V RMS output DAC** (e.g., Pontus or Venus),
* Then placing a **-10dB attenuator at the Terra’s RCA input** is ideal.
