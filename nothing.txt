### ðŸŽ§ **Tracks for Holographic Imaging**

| Artist                              | Track                             | Why It Shines                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lars Danielsson, Leszek MoÅ¼dÅ¼er** | *Pasodoble*                       | Jaw-dropping depth and spatial precision; upright bass and piano float distinctly.           |
| **Dominique Fils-AimÃ©**             | *Nameless*                        | Silky vocal front and center, ambient cues around her â€” vocal layering is pristine.          |
| **Rebecca Pidgeon**                 | *Spanish Harlem*                  | Classic audiophile staple â€” voice is eerily lifelike, guitar and percussion fully separated. |
| **Anouar Brahem**                   | *The Astounding Eyes of Rita*     | Oud, bass clarinet, and hand percussion swirl naturally in a cavernous soundstage.           |
| **Youn Sun Nah**                    | *Hurt* (cover of Nine Inch Nails) | Her voice hovers hauntingly, with subtle shifts in air and depth.                            |
| **Nik BÃ¤rtsch's Ronin**             | *Modul 36*                        | Swiss minimal jazz; pinpoint placement of every note and percussive element.                 |
| **Michael Hedges**                  | *Aerial Boundaries*               | Acoustic guitar on steroids â€” transients leap out in full 3D, recorded at Windham Hill.      |
| **Blue Coast Ensemble (DSD)**       | *The Look of Love*                | Audiophile-label recording with nearly binaural space and depth layering.                    |
| **Ralph Towner**                    | *Anthem*                          | Solo acoustic guitar, ECM recording â€” spatial mic technique is masterful.                    |
| **Imogen Heap**                     | *Hide and Seek*                   | A cappella vocoder piece â€” layers of voice seem to orbit you in 3D.                          |
