Hi Louis,

    This is James writing from Stevenson, WA, the very happy home of a new pair of SAHOs.

    The main purpose of this email is just to extend a huge thank you.  I listen to many, many
    genres of music and everything sounds live, clear, present, musical and beautiful.  Soundstage
    and imaging are awesome.  

    In place is what I already consider to be my first -and last- true audiophile system - no messing 
    around!  The only thing that could change many years from now might be the DAC, but 
    this one seems to be holding up its part very well.

        Bluesound Node Nano streamer
        Denafrips Pontus DAC
        Brunoco Terra 6L6 PP integrated tube amp
        Omega SAHO speakers

    The attached picture shows the current setup.  I have a 12 dB Harrison Labs attenuator between
    the amp and the DAC b/c the amp is at least 20 wpc to win some range back on the volume pot.

    Pictured is a temporary and maybe less than ideal location as the studio / listening room is getting
    worked on.

    The room shown is a bit challenging since it kind of forces the SAHOs possibly too close together.
    Even so, the imaging for near- to mid-field listening, and even farther back, is exquisite.
    I arrived at only a tiny bit of toe-in after starting out with more.
    The soundstage and live, pure tonality are thrilling.

    Do SAHOs generally like to be closer to the side walls?  They are > 1/3 in from their
    respective side walls or even more.  Close to the rear wall is working great for bass response.

    Any observations you have would be extremely welcome. 
    Thank you again for helping put together a dream-come-true audio system.

    James
