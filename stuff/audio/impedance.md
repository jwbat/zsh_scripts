âœ… **Don't connect speakers with a nominal impedance lower than what the amp is rated for.**

### ðŸ§  **Why It Matters**
- Lower-impedance speakers **draw more current**.
- If your amp isn't designed for that current draw, it may:
  - **Overheat**
  - **Clip or distort**
  - **Shut down**
  - Or in worst cases, **damage internal components**


| Amp Rating        | Safe Speaker Impedance     |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| 8 ohms only       | 8 ohms **only**             |
| 6 ohms or higher  | 6 or 8 ohms **(no 4-ohm)**  |
| 4 ohms or higher  | 4, 6, or 8 ohms âœ…           |


### ðŸŽ¯ A Nuanced Version of the Rule:
Sometimes it's okay to connect **"6-ohm" or "4â€“6 ohm" speakers** to an 8-ohm-only amp **if**:
- You're **not driving them super hard**
- Their **minimum impedance doesnâ€™t dip too low** (like your speakerâ€™s 4.9Î© minimum)
- The amp has **headroom** and is **well-cooled**
But thatâ€™s more of a calculated risk than a guaranteed-safe move.
