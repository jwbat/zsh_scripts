**MoviePy** is considered one of the most popular and user-friendly libraries
for working with videos in Python. Here's why it's often favored:

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - MoviePy has a straightforward API that allows you to quickly read video files,
     manipulate frames, and save the processed output.

2. **Rich Features**:
   - It supports a wide range of video editing tasks such as cutting, concatenating,
     applying effects, and extracting frames.

3. **Integration**:
   - Works well alongside other video processing tools and integrates smoothly with 
     NumPy arrays for easy manipulation of frames.

4. **Active Development**:
   - It has an active user base and community that continues to provide support and improvements.

### Basic Frame Extraction Example with MoviePy:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

# Load the video file
clip = VideoFileClip("video.mp4")

# Iterate over frames and save each as an image
for i, frame in enumerate(clip.iter_frames(fps=1)):  # Adjust fps to control extraction rate
    frame_image = f"frame{i}.jpg"
    frame.save_frame(frame_image)
```

- **Flexible FPS**: You can control the extraction rate with the `fps` argument 
   to balance between frame density and processing speed.

MoviePy is both popular and relatively easy to work with, making it a practical choice for most video extraction needs.
