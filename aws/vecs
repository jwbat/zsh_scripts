  On Elastic Container Service (ECS), a \"task\" 
  represents a single unit of work or a set of instructions that run within a container instance.
  
  A task definition in ECS defines one or more containers that form an application or service,
  and specifies how they interact with each other, network and storage resources, and the host environment.
  Each task definition can be run multiple times as tasks, and each task runs one instance of each container
  defined in the task definition.
  
  When you run a task in ECS, the service will schedule it to run on a container instance that meets the task's
  requirements for resources, such as CPU and memory, and network configuration.
  You can also configure tasks to use load balancing, service discovery, and auto-scaling features provided by ECS.
  
  In summary, a task in AWS ECS is an individual unit of work that can be executed within a container instance,
  and it is defined by a task definition that specifies the containers to be run and their configuration.
