### 🥉 **Jack Herer (17 %)**

* **Why it’s third:**

### 🏅 **Super Lemon Haze (17 % Terpinolene–Myrcene)**

* **Why it’s fourth (but still good):**

  * Excellent for *fluid, movement-oriented* meditation.
  * Less ideal for sustained mental stillness — can get a little floaty or unfocused late-session.
* **Ideal for:** breathwork, dance/yoga, open-ended creative states.
