Hello James,

TERRA 6L6PP is not as quiet as other solid state amplifiers regarding AC hum(AC heating of tubes).
However, the hum level is very low so should not bother you-barely audible within 2 feet from the speaker.
I have many customers happy with 100+dB horn speakers with TERRA 6L6PP.
I think what you are experiencing is something to do with AC line of your location(noise coming to your AC outlet from other noise sources).
Isolation transformer(not noise filter) may isolate the AC from these external noise sources.
I think you need to test in other location(not other room in your house).
The crackle is RF interference with the volume pot-it's intermittent and will go away.
Because TERRA is high-gain amplifier, you may feel some white noise according to the matching(with source components). 

Old quality 12AU7 tubes like RCA, MULLARD(UK), AMPEREX(NETHERLAND), TELEFUNKEN(GERMANY) can produce more quiet sound.

If I apply some NFB(negative feedback), then it gets quieter(and low gain)/smoother but that's not my intention of design.

Please try with your new Omega speaker and let me know how it sounds.
Let's start from there.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Kiho
