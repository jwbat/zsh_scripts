    1. \`brew list\`

    2. \`pip freeze\` or \`pip list\`.

    3. Software manually downloaded usually resides in the \`/Applications\` directory.
        You can list them by navigating to the folder and viewing its contents.

    4. **System Profiler**: You can use the \`system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType\`
        command to list all applications, though this will include pre-installed apps as well.

    5. **App Store**: Open the Mac App Store and go to the "Purchased" tab to see apps youâ€™ve downloaded from there.

    6. **npm**: Similar to pip and Homebrew, you can list packages for other package managers

    7. **ls /usr/local/bin**: This directory often contains symlinks to installed packages;
        run \`ls /usr/local/bin\` in the terminal to list them.

    Combining the outputs from these methods should give you a fairly comprehensive list,
    although it may require some manual work to filter out the apps that came pre-installed.
