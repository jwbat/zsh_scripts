### ðŸ”¹ PCM

PCM, Pulse Code Modulation, is the standard digital format for audio  
â€” it's what virtually all music becomes after decoding, including:

    FLAC    WAV      ALAC    MP3     AAC


### ðŸ”¹ Why PCM matters

It's the decoded, uncompressed digital stream that the DAC understands.  
When you play a FLAC file:  
FLAC, a compressed format, is decoded by the player (e.g., Volumio),  
Then sent as PCM to the DAC via AES or Coax (in the case of Pi2AES).
