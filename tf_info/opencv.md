```zsh
pip install opencv-python
```

1. **Optional Package**:
   - For additional OpenCV functionalities, like working with video codecs,
     install `opencv-contrib-python` package, which includes extra modules.

```zsh
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

2. **Virtual Environment**:
   - It's best practice to install it inside a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.
