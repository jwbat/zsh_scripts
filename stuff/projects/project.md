1. Tstat V2 difference documentation


I’d like you to join the Mon 10am mtg for ubx-issue-tstat-reliability .
In particular we need your expertise with the various LoRaWAN
downlinks and uplinks (primarily the main settings like Mode,
Set Point.

But also how schedules are set: Plan vs Banks per downlink)

Also we need to use your tool to analyze from Snowflake whether there are any missing 
1min Tstat uplinks during testing periods.
So far Arthur and I believe periodic uplinks are reliable even in long latency LTE conditions.
But I’d like to be sure.
Actually something immediately helpful would be to look at the uplink stats on this Tstat since install.
This location has strong RSSI but ping latencies of 1sec.
Want to know if the regular uplinks are not getting through because of that:
