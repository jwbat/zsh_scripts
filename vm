    For power cycling the MultiTech Gateway and then trying to get it to connect 
    through the MacBook Internet Sharing, here's a recommended sequence of steps
    to ensure a smooth connection process:

    1. **Turn Off Internet Sharing on MacBook**:

    2. **Power Off the MultiTech Gateway**: - unplug it.

    3. **Wait for a Minute**:
        - This ensures that the MultiTech Gateway is completely powered down and any
          temporary configurations or states are cleared.

    4. **Turn On Internet Sharing on MacBook**:
        - Go back to System Preferences > Sharing.
        - Check the box for Internet Sharing.
        - Ensure that the correct connection is set to be shared 
            (for example, if you want to share your MacBook's Wi-Fi connection over Ethernet,
            select Wi-Fi in the \"Share your connection from\" dropdown and check the Ethernet box
            in the \"To computers using\" section).

    5. **Power On the MultiTech Gateway**:
        - Turn the MultiTech Gateway back on.

    6. **Wait for Connection**:
        - Give it a few minutes to boot up completely and attempt to obtain an IP
          address and other network details from the MacBook's Internet Sharing feature.

    7. **Check Connectivity**:
        - After a few minutes, check the MultiTech's web interface to see if it has obtained an IP
          address and other network details. You can also try to access the internet through it, as previously discussed.

    By setting up in this sequence, you're ensuring that the MacBook
    is ready and waiting with its Internet Sharing feature active when 
    the MultiTech Gateway starts up and begins seeking network details.
    This can help with a smoother and more successful connection process.
