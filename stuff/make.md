Makefile for an SDL/C++ project.
This Makefile is quite straightforward, containing a single target `proj`.


1. `proj:` - This is the target name. When you run `make proj` in your terminal, it will execute the commands listed under this target. If you just run `make` without specifying a target, it will execute the first target found in the Makefile, which in this case is `proj`.

2. `g++ -std=c++20 *.cpp -o m` - This is the command that the Makefile executes for the `proj` target.
   - `g++`: This is the GNU C++ compiler, used to compile C++ code.
   - `-std=c++20`: This option tells the compiler to use the C++20 standard. It allows you to use features introduced in C++20.
   - `*.cpp`: This is a wildcard that includes all `.cpp` files in the current directory as input files for the compiler. It means that every `.cpp` file in the directory will be compiled.
   - `-o m`: This option specifies the output file name. In this case, the executable generated by compiling the `.cpp` files will be named `m`.

3. `-I/opt/homebrew/include/SDL2` - This is an include path option:
   - `-I`: This flag adds the specified directory to the list of directories to be searched for header files. 
   - `/opt/homebrew/include/SDL2`: This is the path where the SDL2 header files are located on your system. It's specific to your system configuration, typically for MacOS with Homebrew.

4. `-D_THREAD_SAFE` - This is a preprocessor directive:
   - `-D`: This flag is used to define a macro.
   - `_THREAD_SAFE`: This is the macro being defined. In the context of SDL2, it's often used to indicate that the program should be compiled in a thread-safe manner.

5. `-L/opt/homebrew/lib` - This specifies a library path:
   - `-L`: This flag adds the specified directory to the list of directories to be searched for libraries during the linking stage.
   - `/opt/homebrew/lib`: This is the path where the SDL2 libraries are located on your system.

6. `-lSDL2` - This links the SDL2 library:
   - `-l`: This option tells the linker to link against the specified library.
   - `SDL2`: This is the name of the SDL2 library that your project is using.

In summary, this Makefile compiles all `.cpp` files in the current directory using the C++20 standard, includes the SDL2 headers, ensures thread safety, and links against the SDL2 library to create an executable named `m`.
