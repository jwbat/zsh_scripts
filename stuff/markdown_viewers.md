There are several CLI utilities that can render markdown files
in a way that closely resembles how they would appear on GitHub.

1. **`glow`**:
   `glow` is a CLI tool that renders markdown files with syntax highlighting and looks quite similar to GitHub's markdown rendering.

   ```sh
   brew install glow
   glow README.md
   ```

2. **`grip`**:
   `grip` is a command-line server that renders markdown files exactly like GitHub does. It serves the rendered markdown on a local server.

   ```sh
   pip install grip
   grip README.md
   ```

3. **`mdless`**:
   `mdless` is another utility that renders markdown files in the terminal, providing a less-like experience with markdown rendering.

   ```sh
   brew install mdless
   mdless README.md
   ```

4. **`mdcat`**:
   `mdcat` is a markdown viewer that renders markdown files in the terminal with colors and styles similar to GitHub's.

   ```sh
   brew install mdcat
   mdcat README.md
   ```

Each of these tools offers a slightly different experience, so you can choose the one that best fits your workflow and preferences.
