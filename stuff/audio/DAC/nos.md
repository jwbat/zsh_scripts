### NOS vs. OS:

* **NOS (Non-Oversampling):** Sends the raw digital signal directly to the DAC with **no digital filtering**. This can sound more **natural or analog-like**, but may include more high-frequency artifacts.
* **OS (Oversampling):** Applies digital filtering and upsamples the signal before conversion. This yields a **cleaner, more detailed** sound, often with improved dynamics.

### Default Setting on Pontus:

* **OS (Oversampling)** is the default setting from the factory.
  The **OS LED** will be lit when it's active.

### In practice:

* **Most audiophiles do prefer OS**, especially in systems where **clarity, detail retrieval, and control** are key.
* OS mode delivers:

  * **Cleaner highs**
  * **Reduced distortion**
  * **Improved dynamic range**
  * **Greater compatibility** with a wide variety of music genres and recordings

### Why some still choose NOS:

* A subset of listeners prefers NOS for:

  * **A more "organic" or "analog" presentation**
  * **Richer midrange** and more **natural vocal timbre**
  * A sense of **flow or musicality** over technical precision

But in general, **OS is the safe, broadly favored default** — particularly in a transparent and resolving system like yours (Node Nano → Pontus → Terra → Omega SAHO).
