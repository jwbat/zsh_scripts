| **Tung-Sol 12AU7 (Reissue)** |     |     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | Warm and musical, good tonal density, solid dynamics. Great value.                                        |
| **PSVANE Horizon 12AU7-AT**  |     |     ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | Spacious, smooth treble, controlled bass, very refined for a modern tube. Ideal upgrade from stock tubes. |

| **JJ ECC82**                 |     |     ‚≠ê‚≠ê     | Serviceable, neutral, slightly flat. Good for budget use but uninspiring in high-end systems.             |
