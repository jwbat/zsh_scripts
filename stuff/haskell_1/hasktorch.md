While Haskell isn't as prevalent in AI systems as Python, there is indeed
some development and research happening in this domain.  
Here's an overview of Haskell's presence in AI:

1. Libraries and Frameworks:
   - Hasktorch: A Haskell binding for the PyTorch library, allowing Haskell developers to use PyTorch's
     deep learning capabilities.
   - Grenade: A deep learning library written entirely in Haskell.
   - HLearn: A machine learning library that leverages Haskell's type system for algorithm selection and parameter checking.

2. Research:
   Some researchers are exploring how Haskell's strong type system and functional programming
   paradigm can benefit AI development, particularly in areas like:
   - Probabilistic programming
   - Automated reasoning
   - Formal verification of AI systems

3. Niche Applications:
   Haskell is sometimes used in AI-adjacent fields where its strengths align well with the problem domain:
   - Symbolic AI and logic programming
   - Constraint solving
   - Type-level programming for encoding neural network architectures

4. Education and Exploration:
   Some universities and research groups use Haskell to teach and explore AI concepts,
   appreciating how its declarative nature can express algorithms clearly.

5. Industry Use:
   While not widespread, some companies are exploring or using Haskell for specific AI-related tasks,
   often in combination with other languages.

Haskell's use in AI is still relatively niche compared to Python, Julia, or even Scala.  
The dominance of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and the extensive Python ecosystem  
makes Python the go-to choice for most AI development.

Haskell's potential in AI lies more in areas where its strengths (strong typing, purity, expressive power)
can provide unique benefits, such as in formal verification of AI systems or in developing novel AI algorithms.
It's less likely to replace Python for general-purpose machine learning and deep learning tasks in the near future.
