## How to think about **MultiWave (MW) On vs. Off**


---

### 🔎 The key variables:

* **The Terra 6L6** is a **tube amplifier**, which:

  * Uses **power transformers**, **rectifiers** (tube or solid-state), and **capacitor filtering** in its power supply.
  * Likely includes **a high-voltage B+ rail** for the tubes and **a heater circuit** for the tube filaments.
  * May be more sensitive to **power waveform changes** than a modern solid-state amp.

* **MultiWave** **flattens**, the AC sine wave peak giving **more charge time** to capacitor-based power supplies.

---

### ✅ **Arguments for MW On (pros):**

* May reduce **ripple** in the Terra's power supply, leading to **quieter operation**, especially in the background noise (blackness).
* Might marginally **improve dynamics or transient response** by ensuring the power supply caps stay fully charged.

### ⚠️ **Caution with MW On (cons):**

* Tube amps have **very specific power supply designs** that may rely on a **standard 60 Hz sine wave** for predictable behavior.
* Altering the sine wave shape—even subtly—can theoretically cause:

  * **Transformers to run warmer** (due to more sustained high voltage)
  * **Increased stress** on vintage-style components like filter caps or tube rectifiers (if used)
* Some tube amp designers **explicitly recommend pure sine wave power only**.

### 🎯 Final Recommendation:

For a modern tube amp like the **Brunoco Terra 6L6**, which likely uses robust, modern components:

* **Start with MultiWave OFF** (pure sine wave) — this is safest and most faithful to traditional power expectations.
* **Test MultiWave ON** briefly — listen critically for:

  * Background noise floor
  * Low-level detail
  * Any unusual behavior (hum, transformer buzz, excess heat)

If it sounds better and causes **no issues**, it’s safe to leave it on.

### TL;DR

> **Default: OFF** for tube amps like the Terra 6L6, to preserve classic power characteristics.
> **Try ON** if you're curious—it might improve power stability, but monitor for heat or noise.
