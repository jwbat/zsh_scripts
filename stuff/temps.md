Your colleague is describing how a temperature value within the range of 10°C to 28°C can be represented and stored in an 8-bit unsigned integer register (uint8) with a resolution of 0.1°C.

Here's a breakdown of the statement:

1. "Set Point Temp has a range of 10C - 28C."
   - This means that the temperature value being represented is expected to fall within the range of 10°C to 28°C.

2. "This can fit in 8-bits (uint8) at 0.1ºC resolution:"
   - An 8-bit unsigned integer register (uint8) can store values from 0 to 255 (2^8 - 1).
   - With a 0.1°C resolution, each increment in the register value represents a 0.1°C change in temperature.

3. "Register => Value
    0 => 100 (10.0 ºC)
    180 => 280 (28.0 ºC)"
   - This part provides a mapping between register values and their corresponding temperature values.
   - A register value of 0 represents 10.0°C (100 in the given formula).
   - A register value of 180 represents 28.0°C (280 in the given formula).

4. "Value (ºC) = (Register + 100)/10"
   - This formula allows you to convert a register value to its corresponding temperature value in degrees Celsius.
   - To get the temperature value, you add 100 to the register value and then divide the result by 10.
   - For example, if the register value is 120, the temperature value would be (120 + 100) / 10 = 22.0°C.

In summary, your colleague is describing a way to represent temperature values between 10°C and 28°C in an 8-bit register, where each register value corresponds to a temperature value with a resolution of 0.1°C. The provided formula allows you to convert between register values and their corresponding temperature values in degrees Celsius.

Yes, the reasoning behind using an 8-bit unsigned integer register (uint8) to represent temperature values between 10°C and 28°C with a resolution of 0.1°C is sound and logically consistent.

Here's why:

1. Range: The given temperature range is 10°C to 28°C, which spans 18°C (28°C - 10°C).

2. Resolution: With a desired resolution of 0.1°C, there are 180 possible values within the given range (18°C / 0.1°C = 180).

3. Representation: An 8-bit unsigned integer can represent values from 0 to 255 (2^8 - 1), which is enough to accommodate the 180 possible values required for the given temperature range and resolution.

4. Mapping: The mapping provided (0 => 100 (10.0°C), 180 => 280 (28.0°C)) allows the full range of 10°C to 28°C to be represented using register values from 0 to 180.

5. Formula: The formula "Value (ºC) = (Register + 100)/10" correctly converts the register values back to their corresponding temperature values in degrees Celsius.
   - For example, a register value of 0 maps to (0 + 100)/10 = 10.0°C, and a register value of 180 maps to (180 + 100)/10 = 28.0°C.

By using an 8-bit register and the provided mapping and formula, it is possible to represent and store temperature values between 10°C and 28°C with a resolution of 0.1°C, while still allowing for efficient storage and manipulation of the values within the CPU's registers.

Therefore, the reasoning and approach described by your colleague appear to be sound and appropriate for the given requirements.
