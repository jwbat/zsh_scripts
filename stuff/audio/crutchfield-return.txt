Jamie: I have set up a return for refund.  Please make sure the item is in the manufacturer’s packaging to avoid a restocking fee.  I will be sending a  prepaid UPS return label to your email.  If you don’t see it your inbox, check your spam folder.  They go there sometimes. Remove any old labels, print and attach the new label.  Take the return to any UPS location.  Returns can take up to 5 business days to arrive and 1-2 business days to process in.  Once processed, we will send a confirmation email.  You should see your refund of .73 post back to your PayPal within 5 business days depending on your bank.
