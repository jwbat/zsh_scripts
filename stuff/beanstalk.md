If not `ssr: false` in config, the Nuxt application will run in "universal" mode,
meaning it will support both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR).
Here’s the added complexity and considerations:

### 1. **Server Environment:**
   - **Server Requirements:** You'll need a Node.js server to handle SSR.
   This means the deployment environment must support running a Node.js server,
   which can be more complex than deploying a static site.
   - **State Management:** When rendering pages on the server, you may need to manage state across server and client.
   For example, data fetched on the server needs to be rehydrated on the client, which can involve additional configuration.

### 2. **Data Fetching:**
   - **Async Data Handling:** When using SSR, you need to ensure that data is fetched and available before rendering the page on the server. This requires using async data hooks like `asyncData` or `fetch` in your components or pages, and handling asynchronous operations carefully.
   - **API Requests:** API requests made during SSR are executed on the server, which might have different behavior or performance characteristics compared to requests made on the client.

### 3. **Routing and Middleware:**
   - **Middleware Execution:** Nuxt's middleware runs on both the server and client, adding complexity since you need to account for the context and lifecycle of the request on both sides.
   - **Redirection:** Redirects during SSR need to be handled differently than in a purely client-side app, ensuring that proper HTTP status codes and headers are sent.

### 4. **SEO Benefits and Responsibilities:**
   - **SEO Considerations:** While SSR improves SEO by providing fully rendered HTML to search engines, you need to ensure that the content rendered server-side is accurate and complete. Any issues with server-rendered content can negatively impact SEO.
   - **Performance Optimization:** SSR can improve initial load performance, but it also adds server processing time. You might need to optimize the server-rendering process to ensure it doesn't slow down your app.

### 5. **Error Handling:**
   - **Error Handling Complexity:** Handling errors in a universal app is more complex because you need to consider both server-side and client-side errors, and ensure they are managed and reported correctly.

### 6. **Deployment and DevOps:**
   - **Deployment Process:** Deploying a universal app typically requires setting up a Node.js server and possibly using a platform like Vercel, AWS, or another service that supports SSR. This can be more complex than deploying a static site.
   - **Server Monitoring:** You'll need to monitor the server environment for uptime, performance, and errors, which adds to the operational complexity.

### 7. **Hydration:**
   - **Hydration Issues:** The process of "hydrating" the server-rendered HTML on the client can introduce bugs if the client-side JavaScript differs from the server-rendered HTML. This can happen if the rendered output depends on dynamic data or browser-specific code.

### 8. **Session and Authentication:**
   - **Session Management:** Managing user sessions and authentication in a universal app is more complex because you need to handle it on both the server and client, potentially requiring more secure handling of tokens, cookies, and session data.

### Summary:
While SSR offers benefits like improved SEO and faster perceived load times, it introduces additional complexities related to server setup, data handling, routing, error management, and deployment. If your application doesn’t require the benefits of SSR (e.g., SEO for a content-heavy site), you might opt to disable SSR to simplify your development and deployment process.
