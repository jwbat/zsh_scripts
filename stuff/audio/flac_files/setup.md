### ‚úÖ Offline Playback with USB Drive

The Bluesound Node Nano supports direct playback from a USB drive containing FLAC files. Once you insert the USB drive into the Node's USB-A port, the device will index the files, allowing you to browse and play them via the BluOS Controller app. This process does not require an internet connection.

### ‚úÖ Control via BluOS App over Local Wi-Fi

The BluOS Controller app communicates with the Node over a local network. By setting up a travel router (like the GL.iNet models you've considered), you can create a dedicated Wi-Fi network. Connecting both your smartphone and the Node to this network enables full control of playback, library browsing, and settings through the app, all without internet access.&#x20;

### ‚úÖ Audio Output via Optical Connection

With the USB-A port occupied by the USB drive, the Node's optical (TOSLINK) output serves as an excellent alternative for audio output to your Denafrips Pontus DAC. This setup maintains high-quality, lossless audio transmission.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

* **Metadata and Album Art**: Without internet access, the Node cannot fetch album art or metadata for your FLAC files. To ensure proper organization and display, it's advisable to embed metadata into your files beforehand using tools like Mp3tag or MusicBrainz Picard.

* **Firmware Updates**: Any firmware updates for the Node or the BluOS app will require an internet connection. Ensure your devices are updated before transitioning to an offline setup.
