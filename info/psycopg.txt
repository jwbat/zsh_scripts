How do I make a statically linked psycopg2 module with ssl support ?

To make a statically linked psycopg2 module with SSL support,
you will need to first install the dependencies for psycopg2 and OpenSSL.
You can install these dependencies using a package manager such as pip or apt.
Next, you will need to download the source code for psycopg2 from the official website or using pip.
Once you have the source code, you will need to edit the 
setup.cfg file to include the path to your OpenSSL libraries.
Then, you will need to use the pip command to build and install the module with the static linking flag, such as:

pip install --no-binary :all: psycopg2 

It is important to specify the flag --no-binary :all: as it will ensure that only 
pure python modules are installed and not any precompiled C modules.
This will statically link the psycopg2 module with SSL support. Keep in mind that this process may vary depending on the specific system and version of the dependencies.
