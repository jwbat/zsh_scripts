I assume you already have a VPC and subnet in place for this, correct? I'll move on with the next steps:

Configure a NAT Gateway:

Go to the VPC console, navigate to "NAT Gateways" (left side menu) and click on "Create NAT Gateway."
Select a subnet.
Follow the prompts to create a new Elastic IP or select an existing one.
Click on "Create NAT Gateway" to create the NAT Gateway.

Now, you can create a security group:

Again in the VPC console, go to "Security Groups" (left side menu) and click on "Create security group."
Provide a name and description for the security group.
Add an inbound rule to allow outbound HTTPS traffic (port 443) to the desired destination.
Assign the security group to the Lambda function later.

Create a Lambda function:

Navigate to the AWS Lambda console (you can use the search box up top)
Click on "Create function" and choose the appropriate runtime.
Provide a function name, select the desired VPC, and choose the subnet.
Expand "Advanced settings" and select the security group created in the steps above.
Write the code for your Lambda function to make the HTTPS call.
Save and test the Lambda function to ensure it works as expected.


Set up an IoT Rule to trigger the Lambda function:

Go to the IoT console.
Create or select the desired IoT Rule.
Configure the rule to trigger the Lambda function you created earlier.
Customize the rule filters and actions according to your requirements.
