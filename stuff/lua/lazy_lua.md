The functions defined by your `create_ft_helper` and `au_python` setup are 
**lazy** because the autocommands themselves are triggered only when the specific `FileType` event occurs.
The actual callbacks (like `py(function() ... end)`) are **not executed during initialization** 
but are registered with NeoVim to be executed **later**, when a buffer with the specified filetype is opened.

---

### **Why This is Lazy**

1. **Autocommand Registration**:
   - When you define an autocommand using `vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd`, you're only **registering** the command during the initialization of NeoVim. The callback associated with the autocommand is **not executed immediately**.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     py(function()
         optl.expandtab = true
         optl.shiftwidth = 4
     end)
     ```
     - The above line registers an autocommand for the `"FileType"` event with the `"python"` pattern.
     - The callback inside `py()` is executed **only when** you open a Python file.

2. **No Immediate Execution**:
   - The `py()` and `lua()` calls register the autocommands, but the actual logic in the callbacks (e.g., setting options, applying highlights, etc.) is deferred until the `FileType` event triggers for the corresponding filetype.

---

### **How Lazy Execution Works in Your Example**

#### During Initialization:
- **`create_ft_helper("python")`** creates the `filetype_python` augroup and a helper function, `py()`, which registers autocommands for Python.
- Similarly, `create_ft_helper("lua")` sets up the Lua-specific autocommand helper.

#### When Opening a Python File:
- NeoVim detects the `FileType` event for `"python"`.
- It triggers the registered autocommands inside the `filetype_python` augroup.
- The corresponding callback functions (e.g., setting `optl.expandtab`, applying highlights) are executed at that time.

#### When Opening a Lua File:
- NeoVim detects the `FileType` event for `"lua"`.
- The `filetype_lua` augroup's autocommands are triggered, and their callbacks are executed.

---

### **Lazy Loading in Practice**
Since the logic inside the `py()` and `lua()` calls is deferred until the filetype is encountered, this setup is efficient and minimizes unnecessary work during startup. Here's why:

1. **Registration Over Execution**:
   - During initialization, NeoVim only registers the autocommands; it doesn't execute their callbacks immediately.

2. **Triggered on Demand**:
   - The callbacks execute only when required, i.e., when a buffer with the specified filetype is loaded.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
```lua
local py = create_ft_helper("python")

-- This registers an autocommand for Python filetype
py(function()
    optl.expandtab = true
    optl.shiftwidth = 4
    optl.notermguicolors = true
end)

-- The callback only runs when you open a Python file!
```

1. When NeoVim starts:
   - The `py()` function is called, which registers the autocommand.
   - No options like `optl.expandtab` or `optl.shiftwidth` are set yet.

2. When you open a Python file:
   - The `FileType` event triggers for `"python"`.
   - NeoVim executes the callback, applying the options `optl.expandtab`, `optl.shiftwidth`, and `optl.notermguicolors`.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Your `py()` and `lua()` functions are lazy because they only **register** the autocommands during initialization.
- The actual logic inside their callbacks is deferred until the corresponding filetype is loaded.
- This is an efficient way to handle filetype-specific configurations in NeoVim.
