 Monday:
Do beta testing of the new Tstat schedules on Dev using your Tstat (discuss testing strategies with @Jason Ives).
Goal is to be on prod on Tues.

I’d like to get back to Milesight with video captures of your test results,
but have some concerns that your unit might need a “factory reset” after downgrading the FW,
if your “settings” were saved in the data model of a newer FW version.
If anyone else has a factory FW1.1 unit (never had alpha/beta FW) and they can do your tests with Toolbox,
that would be a nice cross-check.

Tstat FW Versions
- In looking at all the field WT201v2's, the dashboard is showing V1.1 for them all
- We got 1.3-a1 during development and it’s pinned here and the Canvas suggests we were trying
to consistently develop against that as the latest version
- It’s a bit weird to me that they just recently published V1.2 online (but that we were working with 1.3-a1 long ago).
Don’t raise this yet (keep the focus on the bug you found), but later I may ask them:
    > Can we get a FUTOA binary so we can do V1.1->V1.2 upgrades?
    > What is the status of V1.3 release timeline?
