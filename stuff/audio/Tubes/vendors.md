### Trusted Sellers for Modern High-End 6SN7
| Tube               | Vendor(s)                      | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **Psvane CV181-T MkII** | Viva Tubes, TubeDepot, Amazon (careful) | Warm, lush, good dimensionality. Slightly oversized glass, but fits most amps. |
| **LinLai E-6SN7**       | [Grant Fidelity](https://www.grantfidelity.com) (official North America seller) | Boutique Chinese tube with excellent clarity and imaging. Close to vintage in tone. |
| **Shuguang Treasure CV181-Z** | Harder to find (Shuguang factory currently dormant) | May still appear on Viva Tubes or eBay via verified sellers. |

üîß Important: Psvane and LinLai CV181 tubes draw more heater current than vintage 6SN7s (typically ~0.9A vs 0.6A). Most modern amps, including the Terra 6L6, are likely fine, but double-check the spec or ask the builder.
