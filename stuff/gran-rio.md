#Packing List for the Gran Rio Expedition:

 When heading to Sintiadam, we recommend bringing the following essentials:

    • Long pants (or convertible pants) for worry-free walks, protecting against skin-irritating plants,
      ticks, or mosquitoes. You can comfortably wear shorts on Sintiadam itself.

    • Good walking shoes since you'll be on your feet a lot. Leave the new shoes at home,
      as you wouldn't want blisters during this trip.
      It's advisable to have shoes with a good grip in the jungle, 
      but sneakers will suffice if you don't have specialized hiking shoes.

    • Sunscreen is essential, especially when on the boat to Gunsi!

    • A flashlight or headlamp is a must for all the night walks you'll be taking during this tour.
      It's also handy if you need to go to the toilet at night.

    • Apiapaati is located on the Suriname River, so don't forget to pack your swimwear! 
      You will also visit Gran Dan Sula during this tour.

    • Toiletries; this includes the obvious necessities.
      Don't forget to pack a bottle of mosquito repellent and a towel!

    • Don't forget your identification! As we head towards Atjoni, we will pass through a checkpoint
      where everyone must show their passport if requested.

    • Since you'll see so much beauty, we highly recommend bringing a camera!

    • During the rainy season, we strongly advise bringing a rain poncho.
      If your poncho isn't large enough to cover your bag, consider bringing a rain cover for your bag.

    • A comfortable backpack: Ideally, a large backpack for all your items and a small bag
      that you can keep with you when visiting the village. Additionally, a waterproof bag
      is always recommended as we will be spending a lot of time on the boat.
      If you don't have a waterproof bag, bring a garbage bag that fits your belongings.

    • If you don't have your own hammock and mosquito net, please inform us when registering!

    • Bring a ziplock bag for your phone and other electronic devices. 
      Unexpected rain, especially during the rainy season, can happen.

    • If you'd like to take souvenirs from the interior, now is the time!
      Bring some money (preferably SRD) so you can buy souvenirs from 
      local residents during village walks.
