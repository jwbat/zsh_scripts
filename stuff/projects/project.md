- SQL query to pull all our Landau Elementary data as a bulk download
    all the raw CT sensor data starting 1/5 -- (24 CT's)
    individual CSV files with their timestamps and col headers would be fine

`NRG100` building_uuid: `ed8a0e35-8fb2-4460-8f12-0cec4611a0f2`

Can you let him know which buildings and devices you would like to export (you can use the Asset Name or the 4 digit ID).
    Also any pref on Timezone? 
    Local vs UTC? 
        (Local would be auto-adjusted for daylight savings changes, for example)
