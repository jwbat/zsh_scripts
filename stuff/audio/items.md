### Reviews
I bought the Monitor Audio Silver 100 7G speakers back in May 2024.
The MA speakers produce great sound -- crystal clear highs, great punch, detailed, full bass.
Others who've heard them with my NAD T758v3 amplifier were amazed by the clear and powerful sound.
I can turn up the NAD as loud as I want - no distortion. My ears will go before the speakers do.
I don't think you'll find other bookshelf speakers with the low range these have.
Midrange and highs do not suffer -- both perfectly represented.
I recommend `bi-wiring/bi-amping` them for maximum clarity and dynamic sound.

I wanted to downsize a bit. From a 5.1 system to a 2.1 These 100 7G's were the last piece and I was
quite hesitant as I was replacing some older B&W floor standers. I listened to quite a few bookshelf speakers and was meh.
These were a roll of the dice, but since Crutchfield has a great return policy I went ahead and ordered a pair.
It's taken a few hours of room and EQ tuning after running these for about 30 hrs to break in. I use
a Velodyne SPL1200R sub which has its own EQ setup too. Along with the Dirac EQ in the NAD preamp/streamer I was able
to zero in on a good sweet spot. So, I'm hard to please with audio sound. I am very happy. They sound
bigger than they are. Very articulate sound, not boomy at all, smooth top end. Better top end than the B&W's were. Midrange
is very detailed. These do not sound like bookshelves. Maybe I have a lucky room but I'm happy and recommend you try
these. I listen to Classic Rock, Acoustical anything, Jazz, Blues, Classical, and Metal.
Like any good speaker, you feed it crap, you get crap back. These look fantastically well made. Heavy for size. Walnut looks
great. Wife loves them too. They're not cheap, at least not to me, but you do get what you pay for. I
run these with 120 wpc ATI power amp. Plenty of gas


### **Understanding Nominal Impedance in Speakers and Amplifier Matching**
**Nominal impedance** (measured in **ohms, Ω**) represents a speaker's **average electrical resistance** to the current coming from an amplifier. It is not a fixed value but a rough estimate, as impedance varies with frequency.

Most home and hi-fi speakers have nominal impedances of **4Ω, 6Ω, or 8Ω**,
while some professional or high-end speakers may have different values.

---

### **Why Does Speaker Impedance Matter?**
1. **Amplifier Load Handling** – The lower the speaker impedance, the more current it draws from the amplifier. Some amplifiers may struggle or even overheat if paired with speakers that have **too low an impedance**.
2. **Power Matching** – The amplifier must be capable of delivering enough **power (watts) at the speaker’s impedance** to avoid distortion or damage.
3. **Avoiding Overloading the Amplifier** – Connecting speakers with an impedance lower than the amplifier is rated for can cause overheating, distortion, or even amplifier failure.

---

### **How to Match a Speaker to an Amplifier**
#### **Step 1: Check Your Amplifier’s Impedance Rating**
- Most home amplifiers are rated for **8Ω or 4-8Ω speakers**.
- Some high-end or professional amplifiers support **4Ω and sometimes even 2Ω loads**.
- The amplifier’s manual or back panel should indicate **the supported impedance range**.

#### **Step 2: Match or Stay Within the Amplifier's Range**
| **Speaker Impedance** | **Typical Amp Compatibility** | **Notes** |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| **8Ω speakers**     | Works with 8Ω, 6Ω, or 4Ω-rated amps | Safest option, least current draw |
| **6Ω speakers**     | Works with 8Ω or 4-8Ω-rated amps | Some budget amps may struggle slightly |
| **4Ω speakers**     | Requires 4Ω-rated amps | Some home amps may not handle 4Ω loads well |
| **2Ω speakers**     | Requires 2Ω-capable amp (rare in consumer gear) | Used in some high-end or car audio setups |

#### **Step 3: Consider the Amplifier’s Power Rating**
- Amps deliver different power levels depending on speaker impedance.
- Example: An amplifier might output:
  - **50W per channel at 8Ω**
  - **100W per channel at 4Ω** (more current drawn)
  - **Not stable below 4Ω** (could overheat or shut down)

**Rule of Thumb:**  
- **If the speaker impedance is too low** → The amp **works harder**, produces more heat, and risks overloading.
- **If the speaker impedance is too high** → The amp **delivers less power**, but it won’t be harmed.

---

### **Using Multiple Speakers with an Amplifier**
If connecting multiple speakers to a single amp channel:
- **Series wiring** (adding impedances) → Higher total impedance, less power draw.
- **Parallel wiring** (lowering impedance) → More power demand, can overload the amp.

**Example:**
- Two **8Ω speakers in parallel** → **4Ω total load**.
- Two **8Ω speakers in series** → **16Ω total load** (safer but less power).

---

### **Final Tips for Amp-Speaker Pairing**
✅ **Check your amp's minimum impedance rating** before connecting low-impedance speakers.  
✅ **Avoid mixing different impedance speakers** unless you calculate the total load correctly.  
✅ **Use an amp with headroom**—if your speakers are rated at 4Ω, use an amp designed for 4Ω operation.  
✅ **If unsure, go with higher impedance speakers (e.g., 8Ω)** to avoid stressing the amp.
