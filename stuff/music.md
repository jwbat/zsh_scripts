Middle Eastern-influenced lounge music

1. **Buddha Bar (by Claude Challe & Ravin)** – While not a single band, Buddha Bar is a legendary series of lounge compilations that blends Middle Eastern, North African, and Asian influences with downtempo and chill-out beats. Claude Challe and Ravin, the curators behind it, have helped bring this fusion to global audiences.

2. **Niyaz** – This Iranian-Canadian group, led by vocalist Azam Ali, blends Persian, Middle Eastern, and Indian influences with electronic and lounge music elements. Their music is ethereal, deeply rooted in Sufi poetry, and infused with contemporary production.

3. **Thievery Corporation** – Though they are primarily known as an American downtempo and electronic duo, they frequently incorporate Middle Eastern and North African sounds, especially in albums like *Radio Retaliation* and *Saudade*, which feature Arabic and Persian-inspired instrumentation and vocals.

These artists and projects have played a significant role in shaping the Middle Eastern-influenced lounge music scene, bringing rich, evocative sounds to global audiences.
