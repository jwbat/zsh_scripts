### Upgrade 

Upgrading to the **PSVANE Horizon 12AU7-AT** preamp tubes is a meaningful  
step up from the stock **JJ ECC82** in both **resolution** and **refinement**   
— especially in a revealing system like the Brunoco Terra + Omega SAHO combo.

---

### 🔄 Predicted Sound Changes:  
**JJ ECC82 (stock)** ➝ **PSVANE Horizon 12AU7-AT**

| Trait             | Improvement Likely |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity**       | More **transparency** and less grain — textures come forward more naturally |
| **Soundstage**    | Wider and especially **deeper** — instruments placed more clearly in space |
| **Midrange**      | From "thick and polite" ➝ to **open and expressive**, better vocal presence |
| **Highs**         | Less rolled-off — expect **airier, more extended treble** without harshness |
| **Microdynamics** | Greater nuance in soft passages — **quieter details emerge more cleanly** |
| **Tone**          | Slight shift from warm/thick ➝ to **refined and natural**  |

---

### 🎯 With Omega SAHO Speakers:
- The Omegas are **fast, articulate, and full-range**, so they **expose preamp tube differences very clearly**.
  - **More lifelike spatial cues**
  - **Cleaner note decays**
  - Less “smearing” or muddiness in the midband

---

### 🎼 Listening Notes:
> “Vocals feel more present and human. Cymbals have a fine shimmer instead of a blur. There’s suddenly more air around instruments — and space between them. And the tone feels more *settled*, less shouty or boxed-in.”

---

In short: this upgrade is likely to feel **immediately noticeable**, especially in imaging, air, and vocal presence.
