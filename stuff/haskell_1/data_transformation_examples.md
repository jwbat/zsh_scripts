Data transformation involves converting data from one format or structure into another.
This process is essential in various contexts, such as data analysis, data integration, and data cleaning.
Haskell is well-suited for data transformation tasks due to its functional programming features, strong type system,
and expressive syntax. Here are a few concrete examples of data transformation tasks that Haskell can handle effectively.

1. **Parsing and Processing Log Files**:
   - **Scenario**: You have server log files in a raw text format, and you need to extract,
   filter, and summarize information such as error counts, request frequencies, or response times.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can parse the log files, filter relevant entries,
   and perform statistical analysis or generate summary reports.
   The immutability and pattern matching capabilities of Haskell make it easier to handle 
   and transform log data reliably. <br>  

2. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipelines**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., databases, CSV files, APIs)
   into a data warehouse, transforming the data to fit a unified schema.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can be used to extract data from various sources,
   transform it to match the target schema, and load it into the data warehouse.
   Haskell's strong typing ensures that data transformations are correctly applied,
   reducing the risk of errors during the ETL process. <br>  

3. **Data Cleaning and Normalization**:
   - **Scenario**: You have a dataset with inconsistencies, missing values, and various formats that 
   need to be standardized for analysis.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can clean and normalize the data by applying transformations such as filling
   in missing values, converting data types, and standardizing formats. The functional programming paradigm allows
   for clear and concise definitions of these transformations.  <br>  

4. **Schema Migration**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to migrate data from an old database schema to a new
   one, transforming the data to fit the new schema's structure.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can be used to define the rules for transforming the data from
   the old schema to the new schema, ensuring that all necessary changes are applied correctly.
   Haskell's type system can help verify that all transformations conform to the new schema.  <br>  

5. **XML/JSON Data Processing**:
   - **Scenario**: You have XML or JSON data that needs to be transformed into a
   different format or structure for use in another application.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can parse and manipulate XML or JSON data, applying transformations such
   as reformatting, filtering, and restructuring to produce the desired output.
   Haskell libraries for working with XML and JSON provide robust tools for these tasks.  <br>  

6. **Generating Reports from Raw Data**:
   - **Scenario**: You need to generate structured reports (e.g., PDF, HTML) from raw data collected from various sources.
   - **Transformation**: Haskell can aggregate and transform the raw data into the required report format
     applying calculations, formatting, and summarization.
     The ability to compose transformations functionally makes it easier to build complex reporting pipelines. <br>  

In each of these scenarios, Haskell's strengths in handling transformations functionally,
along with its strong type system, help ensure that data is processed accurately and efficiently.
