System: 
    PS Audio PowerPlant3 plugged into wall AC outlet
    Brunoco Terra 6L6 integrated tube amplifier
    Boston Acoustics HD10 speakers connected to amplifier
    all other source components (streamer, DAC) disconnected

Summary of Issue
- There is consistent white-noise, hiss and hum coming through the speakers when the amplifier is powered on, 
    even with no source connected.
- The noise is very audible up to 6 feet away and is the same in both channels.
- The volume control has no effect on the noise, suggesting it may originate from the amplifier rather than an external source.

Troubleshooting Completed
- I replaced all tubes
    Preamp: from JJ 12AU7 to PSVANE Horizon 12AU7-AT
    Power: from JJ 6L6GC to Tung-Sol 6L6GC
- The issue persists identically with both tube sets.
- Hum and white noise remains present with the amp fully isolated, i.e. no input connections, DAC off.
- the white noise issue worsened substantially and quickly after a power cycling, 
is now heard mostly on the left channel, and is accompanied by crackles and pops.
This occurs regardless of which tubes are installed and is present with all sources disconnected.
The position of the volume knob has no effect on the noise level.
