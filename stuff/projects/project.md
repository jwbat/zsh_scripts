Projects
* Test FUOTA on AWS with WT201 V2
* Python script to better automate batch registration of devices (for mfg/ops)
* Study Humidity Control logic of WT201 V2

* let's have a request to MS with 2 parts:   
    a) confirm the versioning interpretation above 
    b) ask for patch to revert 1.2 -> 1.1

* multi-cast will be straightforward b/c AWS more or less merely asks for more devices to be added.
    The task is configured with a line or 2 for multi-task.
* my present sense is - do multi-cast everywhere on every device with the right starting version, v1.1.
  Schedule it for an off-hour like 2:00 a.m. or similar.  Time zone influence on scheduling - ?
