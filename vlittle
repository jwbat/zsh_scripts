                from queuing theory estimates the avg.
                duration of an item in the system $a

        Little's Law states that the average number of items 
        in a queuing system equals the average rate at which items 
        arrive multiplied by the average time that an item spends in the system. 

        Written out formally, Little's Law is: 

               $y L = 位W $s

        - L is the average number of items in the queue (PIR)
        - 位 (lambda) is the average arrival rate (average rate of people entering the room)
        - W is the average time an item spends in the system (average time a person spends in the room)

        So, to estimate average length of stay (W), you can rearrange the equation:

           $y     W = L / 位     $s

        You would calculate 位 (the average arrival rate) by 
        dividing the total count of entries by the total time period.

        L (the average number of people in the room) 
        is a bit trickier to estimate without knowing the exact times 
        people are in the room. A possible rough estimate could 
        be to take the average of the total number of people 
        in the room at regular intervals during the day. This
        , however, assumes a fairly constant flow of people in 
        and out, which may not always be accurate. 

        Please note that this method provides an estimation and will not be 
        perfectly accurate. It assumes that the system is stable (
        the rate of entries and exits are balanced over the long 
        term), that the flow of people in and out of 
        the room is random and independent, and that the arrival 
        rate and the number of people in the room are not 
        correlated. Violations of these assumptions can result in inaccurate estimates 
        of the average length of stay.
