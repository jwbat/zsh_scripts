## **Dralas**

Invoking dralas is about **creating the inner and outer conditions** for drala energy   
— the **awake, elemental, fearless presence** of reality — to **manifest and support you**.

Below is a structured explanation of the **main methods used in traditional and Shambhala practice to invoke dralas**.

---

## 🏞️ 1. **Creating the Proper Inner Attitude**

Dralas are said to **respond not to force but to sincerity, openness, and fearlessness**.
The primary step is therefore internal:

* **Letting go of ego-clinging:** Before any ritual or offering, the practitioner relaxes the conceptual, grasping mind.
* **Opening to the present moment:** One tunes in to immediate perception — sound, air, light, texture — without trying to control it.
* **Gentle strength:** The warrior’s mind is courageous but not aggressive, alert but not tense.

> *“You can’t own the dralas. They are drawn to your wakefulness like wind to a mountain peak.”* — Chögyam Trungpa

## 🐎 2. **Raising Windhorse (*Lungta*)**

One of the most well-known Shambhala methods of invoking dralas is **raising windhorse** (Tibetan: *lungta* — literally “wind horse”).

* **Windhorse** refers to a **dynamic inner energy of confidence and upliftedness**.
* When windhorse is raised, **dralas are naturally attracted**, like wind to a flame.

### Common practices:

* **Windhorse flags:** Traditionally printed with the windhorse symbol carrying the wish-fulfilling jewel, these are raised outdoors so that the wind carries their blessing.
* **Invocation verse:** Reciting short verses or mantras associated with lungta as the flags are raised.
* **Timing and intention:** Usually done at auspicious times — new year, new ventures, ceremonies — but can be done anytime to invoke clarity.

🕊 *Effect:* This isn’t magic; it’s a **psychological–energetic gesture** that attunes the practitioner to bravery, upliftedness, and environmental connection.

## 🕯️ 3. **Offerings to the Environment**

Another traditional way to **invite drala presence** is through offerings — especially *sang* (smoke offering).

* **Sang offerings** are made by burning juniper, herbs, or other fragrant substances outdoors.
* The fragrant smoke is seen as pleasing to both **outer spirits** and **inner perception**.
* The act is accompanied by **aspirations** or **verses**, often simple, such as:

  > “May all dralas gather. May this land be blessed. May fearlessness dawn.”

### Key principles:

* **Not a transaction:** One doesn’t “pay” dralas to help; one honors their presence.
* **Purification of space:** Smoke offering clears stagnant energies and helps one perceive the sacredness already present.
* **Respect for place:** Dralas are said to abide in forests, mountains, rivers — acknowledging these places is part of the practice.

## 🌿 4. **Sacred Outlook (*Drala View*)**

Even without ritual, **dralas are invoked whenever we see the world as inherently sacred**.

* **Sacred outlook** means perceiving every stone, leaf, gust of wind, or sound as awake.
* It’s a shift from a utilitarian, ego-centered view of the world to a **poetic, direct perception**.
* **The practitioner doesn’t summon dralas** — rather, they *step into their field* by seeing clearly.

This is often trained through:

* Meditation (especially shamatha and vipashyana),
* Contemplative walks in nature,
* Noticing *“small moments of magic”* — flicker of sunlight, sound of wind, bird call — as thresholds.

## ⚔️ 5. **Invocation Rituals in Vajrayana & Shambhala**

Advanced practitioners and some ceremonial settings include more formal elements:

* **Calling the dralas** with short invocations — verses that recognize their presence.
* **Gesture offerings:** Bowing, lifting the hands, sprinkling water or incense.
* **Directional orientation:** Turning to the four directions and center, acknowledging the **dralas of earth, water, fire, air, and space**.
* **Symbols:** Banners, flags, vajra-bells, or tormas (ritual cakes) may be present, but they are *supports for perception*, not idols.

> “Invoking drala is invoking your own warriorship.
> The dralas are not separate from you.” — *Shambhala teachings*
