Review of the Denafrips Pontus 15th DAC manual to determine whether   
all functions—including input selection and mode configuration—can be accessed without using the remote control.


# Operating the Denafrips Pontus 15th DAC Without a Remote

## Front Panel Controls for Essential Functions

The **Denafrips Pontus 15th Anniversary DAC** is designed to be fully operable from its front panel. All essential functions are accessible via physical buttons on the unit, meaning you do **not** need the remote control for day-to-day operation. According to the official user manual, the front panel includes dedicated buttons for:

* **Input Selection:** *Input+* and *Input-* buttons let you cycle to the next or previous input source. The corresponding input LED lights up to confirm the selection.
* **Phase Control:** A **PHASE** button toggles the DAC’s phase inversion (absolute phase). When pressed, the phase indicator LED turns on for in-phase output and off for out-of-phase output. This lets you invert phase from the front panel directly.
* **Oversampling Mode (OS/NOS):** An **OS/NOS** button switches between oversampling (OS) and non-oversampling (NOS) modes. The manual confirms the LED for this button lights up to indicate NOS mode (OS mode when the LED is off). This oversampling toggle is accessible on the unit itself without a remote.
* **Mute:** A **MUTE** button is provided on the front panel to mute/unmute the output. When engaged, the DAC’s input LEDs will flash to indicate the mute status. This allows quick muting directly on the device.
* **Standby/Power:** A front **Standby** power button toggles the DAC between standby and operating mode (the standby LED turns off when the unit is active). This means you can power the unit on/off (to standby) from the front panel.

These physical controls cover all the critical operations. The user manual explicitly states that these buttons provide *“direct control of the audio input source, phase, sample mode (OS/NOS), mute and operating mode”*, underscoring that you can manage all key functions from the front of the unit.

## Remote Control: Optional Convenience (No Exclusive Functions)

**No essential feature is exclusive to the remote.** The remote control (sold separately) offers convenient *wireless* access to the same functions but is not required for any core operation. For example, the remote can change inputs, toggle phase, switch OS/NOS, mute the DAC, and likely put the unit in/out of standby – all of which are achievable via the front panel buttons as described above. The infrared receiver on the DAC’s front accepts these remote commands (if you choose to purchase the remote), but it’s purely for user convenience.

In summary, **the Pontus 15th Anniversary DAC can be fully operated from its front panel alone.** Input selection, phase inversion, oversampling mode switching, and muting are all accessible via physical controls on the unit itself. The optional remote control simply duplicates these functions for ease of use from your listening position, without adding any extra exclusive features.
