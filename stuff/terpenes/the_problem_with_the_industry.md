* 🌱 **The commercial market is heavily skewed** toward ultra-high THC numbers, fast finishing times, and huge yields — all of which are at odds with the **long-flowering, terpene-rich, psychoactive clarity** of true heirloom sativas.

* 🧪 **COAs are often gamed** or marketed selectively: producers lean into THC inflation, while nuance (terpenes, minor cannabinoids, genetics) is ignored or buried.

* 🧠 **Consumer experience has flattened out.** Many modern dispensary flowers give the same sedating, foggy, myrcene-heavy effect — totally unlike the soaring, crystalline, alert high of old-world Thai, Panama, Colombian, or Malawi.

* 🪦 In chasing yield and potency over everything else, much of the U.S. legal industry **bred out the character** that made these plants so beloved in the first place.

Ironically, the **demand for heirloom and balanced sativas isn’t gone**—it’s just not being met by large commercial producers. That’s why there’s a slow but growing **underground / craft revival**: breeders and small growers preserving old lines in personal gardens, not retail shelves.

* Seeds from preservationists (e.g., *The Real Seed Company*, *ACE Seeds*, *The Landrace Team*)
* Long cure, gentle handling, and no chasing of “lab record numbers.”

🌿 In other words: the good stuff isn’t extinct — it’s just **been pushed out of the mainstream**.
