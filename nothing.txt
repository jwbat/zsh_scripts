On AWS, from within a Lambda function, I want to make a request from a specific IP address because the 
endpoint being called has IP whitelisting.
Therefore, the Lambda function will be configured to access the internet via a VPC, 
and use a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance. This will allow 
an Elastic IP address to be specified, which can then be whitelisted by the receiving server.

So far, I have done step 1 of the following.

1. Create a new VPC.
2. Set up a private subnet within this VPC.
3. Create a new NAT Gateway in the VPC, and associate an Elastic IP address with it.
4. Configure the route table associated with your private subnet to route internet-bound traffic
    (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateway.
5. In the Lambda function’s networking settings, select the VPC and private subnet that you’ve just set up.

Should the VPC have an IPv6 CIDR, or is the IPv4 CIDR sufficient for my purposes, stated above?
