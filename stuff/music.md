Dub Pioneers:  Lee "Scratch" Perry, King Tubby, Scientist

### üåç Late-Career Collaborations of Lee ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù Perry

**1. The Orb**

* Albums: *The Orbserver in the Star House* (2012) and *More Tales from the Orbservatory* (2013).
* UK ambient/techno pioneers teamed up with Perry, blending his surreal vocals and chants with deep electronic soundscapes. Many fans see these as proof of how adaptable his voice and vision were across genres.

**2. Adrian Sherwood & On-U Sound**

* Perry had a long friendship with producer Adrian Sherwood, but their later projects (like *The Mighty Upsetter*, 2008) re-energized Perry with thick, modern dub production. Sherwood‚Äôs On-U crew gave him a darker, industrial edge.

**3. Bill Laswell**

* Albums like *Rise Again* (2011, featuring Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, and Tunde Adebimpe).
* Laswell‚Äôs bass-heavy, global fusion style meshed with Perry‚Äôs chanting in some of his most cosmic later work.

**4. Dubblestandart**

* The Austrian dub collective collaborated with him on *Return from Planet Dub* (2009), which also featured Ari Up from The Slits.
* This showed Perry‚Äôs global reach ‚Äî performing and recording with younger European dub innovators.

**5. Aquarium (–ê–∫–≤–∞—Ä–∏—É–º) ‚Äî *Dub in Aquarium* (2020)**

* As you noted, this Russian project with Boris Grebenshikov‚Äôs band and Evgenii Boiarkin as composer/lyricist produced a curious, late cross-cultural dub experiment.

### ‚ú® Why These Stand Out

* They highlight Perry‚Äôs **global appeal**: UK electronica, Austrian dub, Russian rock, US avant-garde jazz/fusion.
* They show how he used his voice as an **instrument** ‚Äî half chant, half prophecy ‚Äî to fit into wildly different musical languages.
* They prove his **restless creativity**: he wasn‚Äôt recycling his 1970s glory, but pushing into new spaces until the very end.

Middle Eastern-influenced lounge music

1. **Buddha Bar (by Claude Challe & Ravin)** ‚Äì While not a single band, Buddha Bar is a legendary series of lounge compilations that blends Middle Eastern, North African, and Asian influences with downtempo and chill-out beats. Claude Challe and Ravin, the curators behind it, have helped bring this fusion to global audiences.

2. **Niyaz** ‚Äì This Iranian-Canadian group, led by vocalist Azam Ali, blends Persian, Middle Eastern, and Indian influences with electronic and lounge music elements. Their music is ethereal, deeply rooted in Sufi poetry, and infused with contemporary production.

3. **Thievery Corporation** ‚Äì Though they are primarily known as an American downtempo and electronic duo, they frequently incorporate Middle Eastern and North African sounds, especially in albums like *Radio Retaliation* and *Saudade*, which feature Arabic and Persian-inspired instrumentation and vocals.

These artists and projects have played a significant role in shaping the Middle Eastern-influenced lounge music scene, bringing rich, evocative sounds to global audiences.
