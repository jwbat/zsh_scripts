I’m trying to clean up and get back in the swing of using both the Roadmap board on Github (which everyone now has visibility to, but should not pay much attention to things beyond Q4 since they aren’t yet well prioritized beyond Q4).
On Monday’s synch (and this will probably become a standard part of every sync for those who can stay for the full mtg), I’d like to go over SW Board live to clean up any missing items or confusions. Some review of the workflow I’m trying to use:
Roadmap column are high level initiatives that should stay in this column (they generally also live on the Board also named Roadmap)
If you are doing work on one of these, you should make a child issue so that the parent can stay in Roadmap, but you can move the child issue(s) across the Board to represent the state of the work. Easiest way to make and link a child issue is to edit the parent and insert - [ ] <subject> which will create a Task llist. After saving this, there will be a “…” option on each Task to convert it to a child Issue.
I’m assigning a lead person to each Roadmap issue which is more symbolic than anything, but a nice reminder of who is primarily working on what. It’s also a good reminder to the Assignee to create a child issue for any work being done on that Roadmap item.
Everyone should have at least one issue on SW Board that is in one of: In development, Ready for review, In review
It doesn’t have to be a child of a Roadmap issue, but if there is a corresponding parent in Roadmap then it should be linked
Please make any updates and we’ll go over on Monday, thanks!
