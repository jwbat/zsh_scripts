Here's a minimal but complete outline of the process GitHub Pages follows to take your Markdown file (`index.md`), `_config.yml`, and custom CSS file (`custom.css`) to a deployable web page:

### Process Outline

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - You push your `index.md`, `_config.yml`, and `custom.css` files to your GitHub repository.

2. **Source Selection:**
   - In the repository settings, you configure GitHub Pages to use a specific branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and directory (root or `/docs`).

3. **Jekyll Initialization:**
   - GitHub Pages initializes a Jekyll build process if it detects the `_config.yml` file or any Jekyll-specific files.

4. **Configuration Parsing:**
   - Jekyll reads the `_config.yml` file to apply the specified settings, including theme selection and custom CSS files.

5. **Theme Application:**
   - If a theme is specified in `_config.yml`, Jekyll applies the theme to the site.
   - Default or custom layouts from the theme are used to wrap the content.

6. **Markdown Conversion:**
   - Jekyll converts `index.md` (Markdown) into HTML.
   - The Markdown content is processed and transformed into a static HTML page based on the specified layout.

7. **CSS Integration:**
   - Jekyll includes the custom CSS file (`custom.css`) specified in `_config.yml`.
   - The custom CSS is linked in the generated HTML to style the page.

8. **Asset Compilation:**
   - Jekyll compiles any additional assets (images, JavaScript, CSS) that are part of the site.
   - These assets are made ready for deployment alongside the HTML pages.

9. **Site Generation:**
   - Jekyll generates the complete static site, including all pages and assets.
   - The site structure is organized into a deployable format.

10. **Deployment:**
    - GitHub Pages deploys the generated static site to a subdomain of `github.io`.
    - The site becomes accessible at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/` or `https://username.github.io/` for user/organization sites.

### Summary of File Roles

- **`index.md`**: Contains the content of your web page in Markdown format. Converted to HTML during the build.
- **`_config.yml`**: Configuration file for Jekyll. Specifies settings like themes and custom assets.
- **`custom.css`**: Custom stylesheet. Included in the generated HTML to apply custom styles.

By following this process, GitHub Pages takes your source files and turns them into a deployable static website. If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
