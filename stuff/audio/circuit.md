# 🧲 1. Isolation Transformer: Cost and Basics

✅ **What it does:**
- Fully **decouples** your audio gear from the incoming grid.
- Blocks a huge amount of **common-mode** and **differential-mode** noise.
- Can **lower EMI** *dramatically* beyond what a conditioner (even Furman) can do alone.

✅ **Cost Range:**
- **Small audiophile isolation transformers (for 1-2 devices):**  
  ➔ ~$500–$1,200  
  (e.g., Torus Power TOT Mini, Equi=Tech 1Q)  
- **Whole rack (15A to 20A, real studio-grade):**  
  ➔ ~$2,000–$5,000+  
  (e.g., Equi=Tech Wall Panels, Torus RM 15/20 series, custom builds)

✅ **Example simple model:**
| Product | Approx Price | Capacity | Notes |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------|:------|
| Torus Power TOT Mini | ~$1,000 | 7A (enough for DAC + Streamer + Amp) | Very clean |
| Furman SPR or P-2400 IT | ~$1,800 | Full rack (20A) | Huge, heavy-duty |

**➡️ But:** you already have a Furman Elite-15 PFi.  
That gives you **partial isolation and surge protection**, though **not true full galvanic isolation** like a giant transformer would.

🏁 **Conclusion:**  
If you get a dedicated line + Furman Elite-15 PFi **now**, *an extra $2k transformer is totally optional* unless you *still* detect noise issues after the upgrade.

# ☀️ 2. Solar Panels and Noise

**✅ Yes, solar panels can inject noise.**
- The **inverter** (DC→AC) is the biggest offender.
- It can produce **high-frequency switching noise**.
- This noise can **backfeed** into the whole house electrical system — *even into new dedicated circuits*, unless carefully isolated at the panel.

**But it depends:**
| Factor | Good Sign | Bad Sign |
|:-------|:----------|:---------|
| Inverter quality | Good ones are quieter (e.g., Enphase, SolarEdge) | Cheap ones spray lots of noise |
| Physical distance from panel | Further = better | Close = noisier |
| Breaker box configuration | Isolating solar breakers helps | Mixing solar/audio circuits is worse |
| EMI meter readings | Low = good | High = need action |

# 🔥 What You Should Do About It

- **Ask your electrician**:  
  ➔ "Can you install the dedicated audio circuit on a breaker *physically separate* from the solar inverters' breakers?"  
  (Simple panel layout matters a lot.)

- **Run EMI measurements** **with solar ON and OFF**:  
  ➔ Shut off solar briefly at its disconnect switch, check if EMI meter readings change.  
  ➔ This will **prove** if your solar is a noise source.

- **If solar noise is significant** even after Furman:  
  ➔ Then maybe consider an isolation transformer later.  
  ➔ Or possibly an extra AC filter between Furman and DAC/amp (cheaper).

# 🧹 In summary for your situation:

| Step | Action | Priority |
|:-----|:-------|:---------|
| Dedicated line for audio | Yes, very good | ✅ |
| Furman Elite-15 PFi | Perfect match | ✅ |
| Solar breaker separation | Ask for it at install | ✅ |
| EMI test solar ON vs OFF | After line install | ✅ |
| Isolation transformer | **Only if EMI still a problem** | 🛑 Optional for now |

Would you also like me to suggest a couple **specific AC line filters** (around $100–$400) that are cheaper than a full isolation transformer *if* you later detect mild residual noise? 🎯  
(They're easier to try before spending thousands.)
