\t$g Nginx $k
\t (pronounced 'engine-x') is a popular open-source web
\t server software that is used for serving static and dynamic content on the web.
\t It is known for its high performance, stability, and scalability, and is
\t often used to serve web applications, reverse proxy, load balancing, and caching.
\t
\t Nginx was first released in 2004 and has since become a popular alternative to traditional
\t web servers like Apache. It is designed to be lightweight and fast, and
\t can handle a large number of concurrent connections with low resource utilization.

\t Nginx supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP,
\t and can be used as a reverse proxy to distribute traffic among multiple servers.
\t It also has built-in load balancing and caching features that help to optimize
\t performance and improve server efficiency.

\t Nginx is widely used by many high-traffic
\t websites including Airbnb, Netflix, GitHub, and WordPress.com. It runs
\t on most operating systems including Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows.

\t Nginx itself is written in the C programming language, but it also has modules
\t that can be written in other programming languages to extend its functionality.

\t One of the most common programming languages used with Nginx is Lua. Nginx has a built
\t -in Lua module that allows developers to write Lua scripts that can be executed within
\t the server configuration. This can be useful for things like dynamic content generation,
\t authentication, and access control.

\t Nginx can also be extended using modules written in
\t other languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. These modules can be
\t used for a wide range of purposes such as adding support for new protocols,
\t handling dynamic requests, and interacting with databases.

\t Additionally, Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy for backend servers running any
\t programming language that can serve HTTP or FastCGI, such as PHP, Node.js, and Java. This
\t allows Nginx to act as a front-end load balancer and caching layer for
\t web applications written in a variety of programming languages.
