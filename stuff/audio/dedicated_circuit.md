**minimal rewiring plan** with the goal of delivering **ultra-clean,  
grounded, stable power** to **Brunoco Terra 6L6PP tube amp**,  
with possible benefit to your whole audio system over time.

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è **Goals for This Plan**
- Provide **clean, grounded power** to your amp (and optionally DAC/streamer).
- **Minimize EMI**, voltage fluctuations, and ground noise.
- **Avoid rewiring the whole house.**
- Lay groundwork for future improvements (e.g., dedicated subpanel, balanced power, etc.).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è **Step-by-Step Minimal Rewiring Plan**

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Identify Ideal Outlet Location**
Choose the **one outlet** that powers your audio system‚Äîideally:
- Close to your rack or amp
- On an exterior wall if possible (for easier cable fishing)
- Far from major appliances, motors, or LED lighting circuits

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Run a **Dedicated 20A Circuit** from the Main Panel**
Have an electrician:
- Install a **12-gauge Romex (12/2 with ground)** cable from your **main panel** to the target outlet.
- Use a **20A breaker** (unless your amp‚Äôs manual requires 15A).
- Ensure it‚Äôs **not shared with anything else**‚Äîthis isolates noise from lights, fridge, etc.
- Use a **metal outlet box** (better shielding) and **EMT conduit** if allowed (more isolation).

üõ†Ô∏è *Optional:* Install a **whole-house surge protector** at the panel now or later (e.g., Eaton CHSPT2ULTRA).

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Install a High-Quality Outlet**
Replace the standard receptacle with:
- A **hospital-grade outlet** (e.g., Leviton 8300-HG, Hubbell 5362)
- Or an **audiophile outlet** (e.g., Furutech GTX-D NCF, Oyaide R1) if you're going all out

These have:
- Tighter grounding and contact tension
- Better vibration damping
- Cleaner metallurgy

Label the cover plate **‚ÄúAudio Only ‚Äì Dedicated Circuit‚Äù** if you want to discourage plugging in non-audio gear.

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Plug into a Quality Conditioner**
Now that the **AC path is isolated and grounded**, plug your amp into a **power conditioner**, such as:
- **Furman Elite-15 PFi**
- **AudioQuest Niagara 1200**
- Or even a **basic isolation transformer** (like Tripp Lite IS1000) for additional line separation

These will **filter EMI/RFI** and **clamp voltage spikes**, optimizing the AC waveform your amp draws from.

---

### ‚úÖ **Optional: Add Quiet Power for DAC + Streamer**
If you want to share this clean line with the rest of your system:
- Add a second outlet on the same run with a **linear power supply** or regulated DC battery setup for the streamer/DAC.
- Keep **digital and analog gear physically separated** when possible.

---

## üß† Recap: What You‚Äôve Done

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dedicated 20A line** | Isolates from rest of home wiring |
| **Grounded Romex** | Provides true safety ground |
| **Hospital/audiophile outlet** | Ensures solid, low-noise AC contact |
| **Power conditioner** | Filters EMI/RFI + protects |
| *(Optional)* Battery/DC gear | Keeps DAC/streamer pristine |

---

## üîå Result
You‚Äôll have **one of the cleanest power feeds in the house**, perfect for high-end audio‚Äîwithout the cost or chaos of whole-home rewiring.

Would you like a part list (breakers, wire, outlets, conditioner), or help drafting what to ask your electrician?
