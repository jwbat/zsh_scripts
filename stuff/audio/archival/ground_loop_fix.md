### ðŸ§° How to fix ground loop issues?



#### âœ… 1. **Use Balanced XLR connections**
- True **balanced connections break ground loop paths** by design.
- One of the best reasons to use gear with **XLR ins and outs** â€” like your Freya+ and Galion amp!

#### âœ… 2. **Isolate sources (TVs, PCs, USB, etc.)**
- These are **common noise introducers**.
- Use USB isolators, optical converters, or ground loop isolators.

#### âœ… 3. **Plug everything into the same power strip**
- Helps ensure **a single ground reference** between all gear.

#### âœ… 4. **Use ground loop isolators (for RCA connections)**
- These can **break the loop**, but sometimes **degrade signal quality**, so use cautiously.

#### âœ… 5. **Dedicated audio power conditioner or isolation transformer**
- Can lift or clean the ground reference for sensitive gear.
- **NOTE:** This can get pricey and overkill unless you're fighting persistent noise.

### âœ… TL;DR:

> A **linear power supply can reduce noise**, but it **wonâ€™t solve a ground loop** or **compensate for ungrounded wiring** on its own.  
> If your house has no grounding, your **best defenses** are:
- Use **balanced/XLR cables**
- Isolate noisy sources (like PCs or TVs)
- Plug all gear into a **single AC power strip**
