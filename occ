                Room Occupancy Representation
$h
  Floor Plan Diagram  $k 
  In each room, show the number of people present. Use a color gradient or size gradient for each room,
  where bigger or darker rooms mean more occupants. The rooms could be color-coded based on occupancy
  levels (heatmap), where a gradient from green (few people) to red (many people) is used. $h

  Stacked Bar Chart $k 
  Each room could be represented as a separate bar on a bar chart.
  The height of the bar represents the maximum capacity of the room. The bar could then 
  be filled up to the point representing current occupancy. Each segment could also be 
  color-coded based on the status of the room: green for available, yellow for partially occupied,
  red for full. $h

  Matrix $k 
  To display data for multiple days or times, use a matrix where rows represent rooms, and columns 
  represent days or times. Each cell could be color-coded based on the occupancy at that time. $h

  Bubble Diagram $k 
  Each room could be represented by a bubble, with the size of the bubble indicating
  the number of people in the room. The color of the bubble could represent the type of room 
  (office, conference room, etc.).
