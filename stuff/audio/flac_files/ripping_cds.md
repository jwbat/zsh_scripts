### ✅ **Why Ripping CDs to FLAC Is a Great Choice**

#### 1. **Convenience & Accessibility**
- Play any album instantly from a computer, streamer, or phone.
- Make playlists, shuffle, or browse your library visually.
- Stream your ripped collection across your home network.

#### 2. **Archival Quality**
- **FLAC is lossless** — once ripped properly, it's identical to the CD.
- You now own a perfect digital archive that will never degrade or scratch.

#### 3. **Better playback options**
- You can use **high-end music players** or streamers with better clocks, power supplies, and digital outputs than most CD players ever had.
- Some streamers offer **bit-perfect playback** with support for sample rate switching, upsampling, or DSD.

#### 4. **Integration with modern gear**
- Once digitized, your music works with:
  - Roon, Plex, or JRiver media servers.
  - Streamers like Bluesound, WiiM, Lumin, etc.
  - Hi-res playback on mobile devices.

#### 5. **Reduces physical wear**
- Your CDs stay pristine.
- You can even store them safely away, or sell them if you legally can (though FLAC copies are still legally grey in resale situations).

### 📈 **Is it common?**
**Very.** Especially among:
- Audiophiles moving to high-quality DACs.
- Collectors preserving rare or out-of-print CDs.
- People tired of swapping discs but wanting full fidelity.

The “CD > FLAC > Player > DAC > Amp > Speakers” chain is now the norm for many who care about sound.

### 🛠️ Suggested Flow:
1. Rip with **Exact Audio Copy (Windows)** or **XLD (Mac)**.
2. Store your FLACs on a computer or NAS.
3. Use a music player (Audirvāna, Roon, etc.) to play to your DAC.
4. Sit back and enjoy gapless, perfect playback — no tray loading needed.
