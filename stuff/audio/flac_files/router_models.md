You're absolutely right — **GL.iNet travel routers consistently earn strong user reviews**, and in many cases they **outshine TP-Link models** for flexibility, performance, and ease of setup — especially in more custom, privacy-conscious, or offline-oriented use cases like yours.

## 🔍 Why GL.iNet Travel Routers Stand Out

| Feature                    | **GL.iNet**                           | **TP-Link**                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Firmware**               | OpenWrt-based (very flexible)         | Proprietary (limited features)    |
| **Offline / LAN-only Use** | Fully supported, easy to configure    | Possible, but sometimes clunky    |
| **UI and Setup**           | Clean, modern, with LAN-only toggles  | More basic, older-style interface |
| **VPN/Privacy Features**   | Built-in support (WireGuard, OpenVPN) | Minimal to none                   |
| **Portability / Power**    | USB-powered, compact                  | Same                              |
| **Community / Support**    | Strong open-source community          | Less active                       |

## ✅ Recommended GL.iNet Models for Your Setup

### 1. **GL.iNet GL-MT1300 “Beryl”**

* Dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4 + 5GHz)
* Gigabit Ethernet ports
* Fast CPU and great signal range for a small device
* USB port for future experiments (e.g. SMB file sharing)
* Highly reliable for **LAN-only music streaming control**

➡️ **Best blend of power and portability**
Price: Usually \~\$70–\$90

### 2. **GL.iNet GL-AXT1800 “Slate AX”**

* Wi-Fi 6 support
* Faster speeds, more overhead if you ever use it for NAS or larger libraries
* Futureproofed — possibly overkill for just running BluOS app, but fantastic for dual use

➡️ **Power user’s pick**
Price: \~\$110–130

### 3. **GL.iNet GL-AR750S “Shadow”**

* A bit older, but still dual-band and very capable
* Smaller RAM and CPU — perfectly fine for just Node control

➡️ **Budget-friendly but functional**
Price: \~\$50–60

## 🧠 Why This Matters for You

Your goal is:

> Use the Node Nano to play FLAC files from USB and control playback from the BluOS app — **with no internet required**.

A GL.iNet router will let you:

* **Create a stable Wi-Fi LAN** for your phone/tablet to connect to
* **Connect the Node Nano via Ethernet**
* Fully isolate from the outside world, while retaining all local playback control

You’ll also have the bonus of:

* A travel-sized, portable network for any future gear or streaming rig
* USB port on the router (in most models) in case you ever want to try **serving FLACs directly from the router** (some support SMB, DLNA, etc.)
