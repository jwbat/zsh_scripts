| 6L6GC (e.g., Tung-Sol 6L6GC-STR) | Balanced, dynamic, tight bass, clear highs | Rock, orchestral, multi-genre   | Superb foundation                |
| KT66              | Richer mids, rounder sound, smoother top end   | Jazz, vocals, acoustic          | Adds warmth without losing clarity |
| 7581A             | Very lively, punchy, strong bass articulation  | Rock, pop, electronica          | Very dynamic; slightly brighter mids |
| 7027A             | Smooth, powerful, clean extended highs         | All genres, especially classical and jazz | Most "neutral but refined"; very articulate |



Start with 6L6GC (like Tung-Sol STR) â€” dynamic, full, will handle your wide music range best.
If you ever want a slightly "richer, more romantic" flavor, try KT66 next.
For even more "crisp and articulate" presentation, 7027A would be stellar.
